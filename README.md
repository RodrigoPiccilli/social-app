# social-app
Social app, most similar to Twitter, where users can post short messages, follow others, and view combined feeds. It features a REST API built with Express that manages users, messages, and follows entirely in memory. The frontend uses Bootstrap for client-side rendering, consuming the API for dynamic content. Containerized with Docker.
